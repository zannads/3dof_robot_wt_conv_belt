# 3dof_robot_wt_conv_belt
 This set of programs are for 3 different part of my high school final project. A 3dof anthropomorphic robot controlled by Arduino. A conveyor belt controlled by a Siemens PLC. A touch screen panel connected to the PLC.

This is how everything evolved.
The time everything was build was 2015 and I was 18 y.o. 

- 3dof robot
A set of motors from an unknown Chinese company were available in the school.
No shield or pieces to mount them were available. 
Arduino was used as controller and a custom program was built starting from a Chinese library ? had found online.
To create the structure I designed the pieces with CAD and printed them with a 3D printer. 

- Conveyor belt
The school already had the materials and the belt was part of the year projects. 
I made the program for the Siemens PLC. 

- A small custom electronic board was made to interface the Arduino with the PLC. (Details have been lost)

- Touch panel for the PLC
The panel was abandoned, no information about the model available. I brought it back to life. Reversed engineered its functioning and made a program that shows the state of the PLC.
